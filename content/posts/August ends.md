## August ends
To whoever is reading: Summer sure has been super busy.

I went across Canada and back, revisited nostalgic places, said hello to many people, and said goodbye to just as many.

I flew my drone (not a lot due to regulations in Canada), tinkered with my camera, and even got a few laptops.

With them, I made a video about where I have been.  [Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ3BbNPn264)

If you are wondering about July, it's a long story with its coverage coming soon.
